        <h2>Getting to know me!</h2>
        <section>
        <h4 class="ctr">About me:</h4>
        <p>Before I began my journey into coding and software engineering, I helped build and maintain a screen department for a local tech company. 
          My department was responsible for building laptop screens for retail giants like BestBuy all the way down to your neighborhood computer repair shop. 
          This wonderful opportunity allowed me to recruit, guide, and develope a small team of eager and inquisitve minds to tackle the building, testing, and troubleshooting
          of cutting-edge hardware while satisfying my personal desire to play with all the new, shiny toys in the tech world! After years mastering the hardware 
          side, I've decided to turn my attention to learning about the inner workings of these incredible machines!</p>
